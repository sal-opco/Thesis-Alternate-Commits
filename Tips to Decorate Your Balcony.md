1. ##### Think about the balcony shape and proportions

   When you have a small space, it is important to understand the proportion of i.e. the size of two objects and the same should be in sync. In this scenario, it is easy to remember that all the furniture and designing should be appropriate to the size of your apartment/condo balcony. Thin furniture and sleek designs are best if you have a small balcony. If you have more square footage, you could opt for bigger pieces and statement pieces that can transform your balcony from a simple space to something that is a gem of your home décor story. ![](https://www.avso.org/wp-content/uploads/files/7/5/3/balcony-furniture-build-yourself-garden-furniture-set-0-753.jpg)

   

2. ##### The Trick is Layering!

   To make the space cozy and welcoming you can opt for the layering technique. In your balcony, you can achieve this by the use of different textiles in the form of a washable outdoor rug, colorful and cheery throw pillows, comfy cushions and even a warm blanket for the windy, and cold days. The trick is to keep everything multi-functional and inexpensive because it is outdoors and may need frequent changes and sprucing up.

3. ##### Let There be Light!

   Lighting can make any space feel special and homey! If it is your forever home, you can add permanent lighting fixtures to your ceiling or walls that add a certain pizzazz to a place. If you are looking for ways to decorate your balcony in a rented place, use string lights, antique lamps, and candles to lend a warm touch. In the evenings, the lights add a certain charm to the unmatched outdoor setting. Imagine sitting on your sofa after a long day of work, under the lights! We believe that it is the small pleasures like your happy corner that can give you the strength for the next day of hard work.

5. ##### Choose Balcony Furniture According to Décor and Longevity

   If you have a balcony without a roof (kind of like a patio), then it would be good to invest in some waterproof furniture that is not very costly. Straw furniture is a classic, and also metal ones. You can add waterproof cushions for comfort and a cosy feeling. Or buy cheap furniture that is okay even if it gets ruined in the sun, rain and dust.
