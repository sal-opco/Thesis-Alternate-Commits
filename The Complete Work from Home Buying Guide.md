#### **Ergonomic Home Office Chair for All-Day Good Posture**![](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2360/6457/products/NC_SILVER_3-min.jpg?v=1542640589)



Be honest, as you are reading this - what way are you sitting? Chances are your common sitting position is hunchbacked and a lowered neck position. If you know that you would spend 8 - 10 working hours a day, having a good posture is so important. Sitting on a dining chair or deck chair could injure your back and neck in the long run. Specially when we sit with our necks craned down over our mobile screens. Other chairs are rarely at the right height, and they are not shaped for prolonged usage.  

There are a lot of ergonomic office chairs available in the market today specially customised for gaming, for office use, for perfect back support. Depending on your preferences, you can choose one with adjustable height, which can roll, has good seat tilt, and lateral arm position.  With a good arm rest, your forearm should rest on the arm rest very lightly. We also propose a wrist rest below that is ideal for rest your forearms. 

An extremely good ergonomic chair is very expensive bit worth the investment. The ergonomic chair from Misuraa is imported, with excellent ratings and unparalleled quality.

A study table lamp is very important if you do not have a natural light source in your workspace. Some people also prefer to stay away from the sun, so it is imperative to have a lamp that can provide sufficient light to all ends of your desk during the day and night.

#### Multi-Purpose Ergonomic Tables

![](https://www.upliftdesk.com/content/img/pages/ergonomic-calculator/uplift-calculator-page-ergonomic-sitting.jpg)

The most important base for your setup would be the desk where all your computer is set, the accessories for a productive day of work are placed. Some people are also opting for standing desks because the sitting around all day becomes monotonous.  If you work more with electronics, then you would need an office table with the correct wire sections/cut outs. If you are creative, then having a big workspace for all your notebooks and accompanying tools becomes a priority. A desk with the right height, with the correct drawers, and dedicated space for all your work things can be time consuming to find so our top picks are given below. 

This one has a Nordic design, comes with a footrest and drawers.

#### Fast Wireless Router

![](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51R2a9p-vNL._AC_SL1000_.jpg)

The most important tool for working online is an excellent internet connection, for which you should invest in an excellent router. If there are multiple people who are using the same internet connection, then a router with good parallel capabilities and fast speed (5GHz) option could be set up. Our recommendations are below:

TP Link is a trustworthy name for routers. And this one is an ideal option in a good range.
